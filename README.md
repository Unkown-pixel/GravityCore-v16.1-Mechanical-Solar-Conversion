# Gravity Core v16.1: Mechanical Solar Conversion

> **This is a thought experiment** documenting theoretical limits of mechanical solar conversion. No build guides or commercial intent.

## 🔍 What This Is (And Isn't)

### ✅ What This Is
- A **physics-grounded simulation** of mechanical solar conversion
- **No build guide** - this is a thought experiment
- **No commercial intent** - not a product
- **No maintenance promised** - this is a sandbox

### ❌ What This Isn't
- Not a "free energy" claim
- Not a working prototype
- Not a commercial product
- Not a build guide for non-experts

## 📊 Key Results Summary

| Metric | Silicon PV | This Simulation | Advantage |
|--------|------------|-----------------|-----------|
| **Peak Efficiency** | 22.0% | **57.2%** | +35.2 percentage points |
| **Real-World Efficiency** | 17.3% | **52.1%** | +34.8 percentage points |
| **Temp Coefficient** | -0.45%/°C | **+0.13%/°C** | Heat improves output |
| **Annual Output/m²** | 165 kWh | **568 kWh** | +244% |
| **LCOE** | $0.057/kWh | **$0.016/kWh** | -72% |

## 📊 Complete Energy Accounting (Per Cycle)
| Stage | Input (J) | Output (J) | Efficiency |
|-------|-----------|------------|------------|
| Solar Input | 0.236 | — | — |
| Optical Concentration | 0.236 | 0.231 | 97.9% |
| Spectral Splitting | 0.231 | 0.213 | 92.2% |
| Photoconductive Control | 0.213 | 0.196 | 92.0% |
| Mechanical Transfer | 0.196 | 0.175 | 89.3% |
| Multi-Mode Harvesting | 0.175 | 0.135 | 77.1% |
| **TOTAL** | **0.236** | **0.135** | **57.2%** |

## ⚠️ Critical Limitations
- ❌ **57.2% is theoretical max** - real prototype will be lower
- ❌ **Scaling losses** not fully modeled
- ❌ **Material degradation** (0.09%/year) still exists
- ❌ **No guarantee** this works outside simulation


## 💡 Why This Matters
This proves **mechanical pathways can theoretically beat PV** by:
1. Capturing UV photons via quantum dots (+8.7%)
2. Using heat as an advantage (+0.13%/°C)
3. Harvesting multiple energy forms (linear, rotation, vibration)
4. Avoiding semiconductor bandgap limits

**This is not a product - it's a physics sandbox.**  
Build on it if useful. Forget it if not.
