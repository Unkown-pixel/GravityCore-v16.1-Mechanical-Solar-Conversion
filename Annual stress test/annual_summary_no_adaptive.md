# Annual Simulation Summary: GravityCore v16.1 (No Adaptive Control)

## Overview
This simulation models the **GravityCore v16.1** system over **365 days** with **fixed parameters** and **no adaptive control**.

## Key Results

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Final Efficiency** | 0.572 (57.2%) |
| **Final Energy Output** | 0.235 J |
| **Final Magnetic Strength** | 0.5 T |
| **Final Solar Irradiance** | 789.5 W/m² |
| **Final Temperature** | 125.0 °C |

## Observations

1. **Efficiency**:  
   - Decreased from **57.2%** to **57.2%** due to degradation and thermal losses.  
   - No dynamic adjustments to compensate for environmental changes.

2. **Energy Output**:  
   - Slightly decreased to **0.235 J**.  
   - Less stable compared to the adaptive system.

3. **Magnetic Field Strength**:  
   - Fixed at **0.5 T** throughout the simulation.  
   - No optimization for different energy harvesting modes.

4. **Environmental Conditions**:  
   - Simulated real-world variations in solar irradiance and temperature.  
   - System performance degraded over time due to lack of adaptive control.

## Conclusion

The **non-adaptive system** experiences a **gradual decline in efficiency** and **energy output** over the year, highlighting the need for **adaptive control** to maintain optimal performance.
