# How to Contribute

This repository documents a thought experiment in mechanical solar conversion. Contributions are welcome but should follow these guidelines:

## What to Contribute
- **Physics validation**: Code that verifies or challenges the physics assumptions
- **Gap analysis**: Documentation of where energy goes (or is lost)
- **Alternative approaches**: Different mechanical conversion pathways
- **Real-world constraints**: Manufacturing or material limitations

## What NOT to Contribute
- "Free energy" claims that violate thermodynamics
- Unverified efficiency claims without energy accounting
- Build guides for non-experts (this is a thought experiment)
- Commercialization plans (this isn't a product)

## Contribution Process
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/your-feature`)
5. Create a new Pull Request

## Important Notes
- **This is not a build guide** - it's a physics sandbox
- **No maintenance promised** - this is a thought experiment
- **Be specific** - show exactly where physics assumptions may fail
- **Energy accounting is mandatory** - track every joule
