## üó∫Ô∏è Project Roadmap

- **Phase 1 (0-3 months):** Validate simulation results experimentally
- **Phase 2 (3-6 months):** Optimize hourglass geometry and magnetic field modulation
- **Phase 3 (6-12 months):** Develop a small-scale prototype
- **Phase 4 (12+ months):** Explore hybrid systems with traditional PV
