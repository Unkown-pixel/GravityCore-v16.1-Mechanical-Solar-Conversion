## 🤝 Collaboration & Research Opportunities

I'm actively seeking researchers to help explore the **true limits of mechanical solar conversion**. If you're interested in:

- Improving the hourglass geometry to reduce viscous losses
- Optimizing the magnetic field modulation for better efficiency
- Developing new materials for the photoconductive layers
- Validating the 100-day simulation results experimentally

**Please email me at:**

I welcome collaborations, feedback, and new ideas!
