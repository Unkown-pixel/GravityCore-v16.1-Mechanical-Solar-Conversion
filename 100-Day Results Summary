 Energy Output:
Starts at 0.236 J
Slightly decreases due to thermal losses
Ends at 0.235 J

 Temperature:
Starts at 25Â°C
Increases by 0.1Â°C per day
Ends at 125Â°C after 100 days

 Material Degradation:
Starts at 0%
Increases by 0.12% per day
Ends at 12.0% after 100 days

 Thermal Losses:
Starts at 0%
Increases by 0.05% per day
Ends at 5.0% after 100 days

 ğŸ“Œ Conclusion

After 100 days of simulation:

Efficiency decreased from 57.2% to 56.8%
Energy output decreased from 0.236 J to 0.235 J
Temperature increased from 25Â°C to 125Â°C
Material degradation reached 12.0%
Thermal losses reached 5.0%

 ğŸ“Œ The system remains stable but shows signs of thermal runaway risk at higher temperatures.
