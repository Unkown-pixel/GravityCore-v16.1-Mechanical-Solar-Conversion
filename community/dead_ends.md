# Where NOT to Waste Time: GravityCore Dead Ends

## ❌ "This is Free Energy"

- **Reality**: All energy comes from the sun. The system doesn't create energy - it converts it more efficiently.
- **Why it's wrong**: Violates the first law of thermodynamics (conservation of energy).
- **What to do instead**: Focus on energy conversion efficiency, not "free energy" claims.

## ❌ "We Can Scale This to 100% Efficiency"

- **Reality**: Fundamental limits (thermodynamics, quantum mechanics) prevent 100% efficiency.
- **Why it's wrong**: The Carnot limit for thermal systems is ~90% for extreme temperature differences, but we're not using a heat engine.
- **What to do instead**: Focus on incremental improvements within physical limits.

## ❌ "This Replaces Solar Panels Completely"

- **Reality**: Different applications - PV for steady electricity, GravityCore for high-temperature environments.
- **Why it's wrong**: They serve different purposes and can work together.
- **What to do instead**: Explore hybrid systems combining both technologies.

## ❌ "Ignoring Material Degradation"

- **Reality**: All materials degrade over time.
- **Why it's wrong**: 0.12%/year degradation is significant for long-term applications.
- **What to do instead**: Research durable materials and self-repair mechanisms.

## ❌ "The Temperature Coefficient is Magic"

- **Reality**: +0.13%/°C is real but limited by material properties.
- **Why it's wrong**: This only applies up to the point where thermal runaway occurs (~120°C).
- **What to do instead**: Design systems that maintain optimal temperature.

> **Remember**: This is a **thought experiment**, not a commercial product. The real value lies in the **physics insights** it provides.
