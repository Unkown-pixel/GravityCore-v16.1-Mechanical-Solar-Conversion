# Collaboration Guidelines for GravityCore

## 🤝 Core Principles

1. **Physics First, Not Hype**  
   - All claims must be grounded in verified physics
   - No "game-changing" claims without energy accounting

2. **Transparency is Mandatory**  
   - All contributions must include:
     - Clear explanation of physics principles
     - Limitations of the approach
     - References to supporting literature

3. **No Commercialization Pressure**  
   - This is a research sandbox, not a product
   - No patents, no investment pitches, no commercialization

## 📋 Contribution Requirements

### ✅ What to Contribute
- **Physics validation**: Code that verifies or challenges the physics assumptions
- **Energy accounting**: Detailed tracking of every joule in the system
- **Alternative pathways**: Different mechanical conversion approaches
- **Real-world constraints**: Manufacturing, material, and environmental limitations

### ❌ What NOT to Contribute
- "Free energy" claims that violate thermodynamics
- Unverified efficiency claims without energy accounting
- Build guides for non-experts
- Commercialization plans
- Personal opinions without scientific basis

## 🔍 Validation Process

1. **Initial Submission**  
   - Fork the repository
   - Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature`)
   - Commit changes with descriptive messages (`git commit -am 'Add your feature'`)

2. **Physics Review**  
   - All contributions must pass physics validation:
     - Energy conservation check (input ≤ output)
     - Thermodynamic feasibility (no perpetual motion)
     - Reference to established literature

3. **Peer Review**  
   - Contributions are reviewed by at least 2 independent researchers
   - Feedback must be constructive and physics-based
   - Revisions required until consensus is reached

4. **Documentation Update**  
   - All contributions must include:
     - Clear explanation of physics principles
     - Limitations of the approach
     - References to supporting literature

## 📊 Success Metrics

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| **Physics Validity** | 100% |
| **Transparency** | 100% |
| **Collaboration** | 5+ active contributors |
| **Energy Accounting** | Complete for all processes |
| **Real-World Relevance** | 3+ practical applications identified |

> **Final Note**: This is a **community asset**, not an individual project. The real value lies in the **collective understanding** of energy conversion physics.
