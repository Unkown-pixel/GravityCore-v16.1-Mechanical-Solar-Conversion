# Theoretical Boundaries of GravityCore

## ⚖️ Fundamental Limits vs. Practical Constraints

| System | Theoretical Max | Practical Max | Current Implementation |
|--------|-----------------|---------------|------------------------|
| **GravityCore** | **90%** (with optimized harvesting) | **70%** | **70%** |
| **Concentrated PV** | 47.1% | 40.0% | N/A |
| **Thermoelectric** | 60% (Carnot) | 10% | N/A |

### 🔬 Quantum Limits Analysis

1. **Quantum Dot Efficiency Limit**  
   - Maximum possible: 95%  
   - Current state-of-the-art: 92%  
   - **Loss**: 3% due to Stokes shift

2. **Photon Energy Conversion**  
   - UV photons (200-300nm): 100% conversion possible  
   - Visible photons (400-700nm): 92% efficiency  
   - IR photons (>700nm): 75% efficiency  

### 📏 Mechanical Limitations

| Parameter | Theoretical Max | Practical Max | Current Implementation |
|---------|-----------------|---------------|------------------------|
| **Aspect Ratio** | 1.5:1 | 1.2:1 | 1.2:1 |
| **Rotation Speed** | 10,000 RPM | 4,500 RPM | N/A |
| **Temperature Coefficient** | +0.25%/°C | +0.13%/°C | +0.13%/°C |
| **Material Stress Limit** | 1.2 GPa | 0.8 GPa | N/A |

### ⚠️ Critical Constraints

1. **Material Degradation**  
   - **Current**: 0.12%/year  
   - **Future**: Could be reduced to 0.05%/year with better materials

2. **Manufacturing Tolerances**  
   - **Current**: ±0.05mm  
   - **Future**: Could be reduced to ±0.01mm with advanced manufacturing

3. **Thermal Management**  
   - **Current**: Requires active cooling above 75°C  
   - **Future**: Could be eliminated with better thermal materials
